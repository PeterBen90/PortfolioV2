                    <h3 class="moz-sub">Fast follow</h3>
                    <p  class="moz-body">After implementation we added a fast follow up to the feature. When first time users signed up and logged into the VPN, their location was populated with a random server. One thought we had was <i class="bold">“What if the users never navigated to select a new location?”</i></p>

                    <p  class="moz-body">Working together with the Product Manager and the Engineers, we were able to add a pretty important part to this feature. Now, when a first time user enters the application, we will quickly do a latency ping and populate the default location with the best performing server at the time.</p> </br>

                        <p  class="moz-body">I love to highlight this case study because it's really awesome to see how such a small and simple change can make such a HUGE impact. On the serface we didn't redesign any entire screens or do anything revolutionary, but we managed to address a user need, and our business needs elegantly.</p> 

                        <ul class="moz-body">
                            <li class="bold">We observed almost 2x the amount of people (~92%) using the recommended server list over selecting a custom server location</li>
                            <li class="bold">Support tickets related to “How to use VPN?” dropped 64%</li>
                            <li class="bold">Support tickets for speed and performance dropped 58%</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="moz-sub center">What did we do next?</h3>
                        <p class="moz-body center">With these positive results, we continued to monitor the performance of these changes, but there’s always much more to do. This led to a much more ambitious change to help with speed and performance related complaints, the Mozilla VPN embedded speedtest…</p>
