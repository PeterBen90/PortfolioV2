Mozilla VPN was a relatively new product, and our other products were still only in the “freemium” phase.</p>

We knew we needed a design system, and having built a design system at my previous company, my task was to own the creation of an org-wide design system from scratch.</p>

                    <p class="moz-body">Before starting, I had to determine the product and business goals. This included internal interviews with the design team, engineering team and managers. I needed to understand their business goals and our product goals.</p>

                     <ol class="moz-body">
                        <li>Create efficiency for our design team, by saving time and the company money</li>

                        <li>Create true design consistency between 4 different product offerings</li>

                     <p  class="moz-body">I owned and led this initiative as the sole designer. I was responsible for research, execution and documentation of the visual assets and documentation. I also worked together with a team of 10+ talented UX people to create a design language that would be the foundational piece to everything we do.</p>
                     <p  class="moz-body">The design system launched company-wide in early 2022, and the design language launched in early 2023.</p>

                    <p  class="moz-body">The Mozilla brand has a design system called Protocol that was used for mainly marketing related web surfaces, the font sizing, line height and font weights would all be reused in our system. The only thing we would change would be the font pairing. We would use the same font-families used in the Firefox design system - the Firefox fonts are more UI friendly. I worked with engineers to add design tokens that matched the CSS classes within the codebase to create consistency between the design and the code.</p>

                    <p  class="moz-body">Another thing we were able to salvage from the previous system was the colour palette. We essentially used the same palette as all Mozilla/Firefox products, with a few additions. The lead designers for all of the core “Privacy and Security” products worked together to create primary color palettes for each product, and use these primary colours to inform minor tweaks to the larger, more robust secondary palette.</p>

                        <p  class="moz-body">The Privacy and Security UX design team traveled to Austin, TX and during this work week, one of the main items of work we needed to accomplish was to create design principles. These principles would be the foundation of our design language, and round off the last pillar of our design system.</p>

                        <p  class="moz-body">Although we had already launched the visual components of the design system much earlier than we created our core principles, the completion of this work felt extremely validating for our team. I think the impact goes much deeper than increased design efficiency and consistency, but it solidified us as a real org within Mozilla. Here are my “some data, mostly vibes” impacts:</p> 

                        <ul class="moz-body">
                            <li class="bold">Company-wide design system acknowledgment</li>
                            <li class="bold">A cross-functional source of truth for everyone on our team to use</li>
                            <li class="bold">Time and money saved on faster more efficient designs</li>
                            <li class="bold">A solid foundation of 40+ components and 1000+ variants, to scale</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="moz-sub center">What did we do next?</h3>
                        <p class="moz-body center">The plan was to round off our design system by working together with content to create our “Voice and Tone” content guidelines. We also planned to move Nebula’s documentation from inside Figma to a docs hosting site called Supernova. <span class="bold">This work was set to kickoff, but never materialized due to layoffs.</span></p>
