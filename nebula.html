                    <p class="moz-body">Before starting, I had to determine the product and business goals. This included internal interviews with the design team, engineering team and managers. I needed to understand their business goals and our product goals.</p>

                     <p  class="moz-body">I owned and led this initiative as the sole designer. I was responsible for research, execution and documentation of the visual assets and documentation. I also worked together with a team of 10+ talented UX people to create a design language that would be the foundational piece to everything we do.</p>

Our job was to stop users from dropping off before this point, by improving account conversion rate we would in turn be improving subscription conversion rate.</p>

We decided to add a product onboarding to inform the user about the benefits of Mozilla VPN pre-purchase. I led the delivery of this, and created the animations as well...</p>
