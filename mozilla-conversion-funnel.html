                            <p class="moz-body-white">Early 2022, we ran an initial review of our mobile and desktop ad campaigns, and we highlighted a need to “improve conversion rates from installs to subscriptions to gain efficiency in CPA (Cost per acquisition).</p>
    
                             <p  class="moz-body-white">We found that users were dropping off very early in the process, once the users got to the subscription screen that number dropped to ~50% of people ended up subscribing. Our task was to find out what might be triggering this huge early drop off, and improve the account conversion rate, in turn, improving the subscription conversion rate.</p>

                    <p class="moz-body">Before getting to the discovery, we had to determine the product and business goals. What issues, if any, were the users experiencing early in the funnel and how do we solve these issues in order to bring our account conversion rate up?</p>

                        <p class="moz-body center">We were able to identify another friction point in the funnel. Users weren’t quite sure what they can use VPN for and why Mozilla VPN specifically. We decided to add a product onboarding to inform the user about the benefits of Mozilla VPN pre-purchase. I led the delivery of this, and created the animations as well…</p>
